# cobol
this project uses https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/ to run cobol directly on normal pcs without the need of a mainframe. as such there will be no jcl code here.
coding is done in vscodium using the IBM.zopeneditor plugin for syntax highlighting and language server. this is not a perfect match for gnucobol, but seems fine so far.
